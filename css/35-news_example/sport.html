                        </h4>
                        <img class="img-fluid-col2" src="img/federer.jpg" alt="Roger Federer">
                        <p class="news-text">
                            Roger Federer has confirmed he will play in this year's French Open as he continues his
                            return from injury.
                            Federer, 39, is making his comeback after two knee operations and has not played a Grand
                            Slam since January 2020.
                            The 20-time Grand Slam winner made his return after 14 months out at last month's Qatar Open
                            but has not played since.
                            On Sunday, he said will play the clay-court Geneva Open in May followed by Roland Garros,
                            which begins on 30 May.
                            Federer, who won his only French Open title in 2009, overcame Britain's Dan Evans in his
                            comeback match in Doha last month but was then beaten by Nikoloz Basilashvili in the next
                            round.
                            After losing to Novak Djokovic in the 2020 Australian Open, he had an operation on his right
                            knee and after a further setback was ruled out of the entire coronavirus-hit season.
                            He had hoped to return at this year's Australian Open in January but "ran out of time" to
                            regain fitness.

                        <p class="news-text">
                            Mason Greenwood says "anything is possible" in the title race after he scored twice to help
                            Manchester United beat Burnley and close the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester City
                            to eight points.
                            The 19-year-old saw his thumping opener after the break quickly cancelled out when James
                            Tarkowski rose above Harry Maguire to level.
                            Greenwood put the hosts back in front six minutes from time with a fierce left-footed strike
                            that deflected beyond goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell at the front post.
                            Edinson Cavani then tapped in from close range in stoppage time to wrap up the victory at
                            Old Trafford.
                            The visitors' direct attacking play had caused United problems of their own and they had the
                            ball in the net after 14 seconds.
                            Chris Wood beat goalkeeper Dean Henderson to a floated delivery on the edge of the penalty
                            area and headed into an empty goal, only to be correctly flagged offside.
                            It means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are now eight points behind leaders City in second
                            place with six games to play, while Burnley remain 17th and six points above the relegation
                            zone.

                                Barcelona scored four goals in 12 minutes - including a brilliant strike from Lionel
                                Messi - to thrash Athletic Bilbao and win the Copa del Rey.
                                Barca were frustrated until the 60th minute when Antoine Griezmann turned in Frenkie de
                                Jong's cross before De Jong headed in himself three minutes later.
                                Messi then drove from his own half, exchanged twice with De Jong and found the bottom
                                corner for Barca's third.
                                Messi added his second four minutes later, sweeping in Jordi Alba's cross.
                                Victory gives Barca their first trophy under manager Ronald Koeman and their first
                                silverware since 2019.
                                "To win a title is important for me," said Koeman, whose side are third in La Liga - two
                                points behind leaders Atletico Madrid.
                                "Despite the changes at the club and the young players, at Barca you have to always
                                fight for trophies.
                                "We have the first one and now we are going to fight to the last game in La Liga."
                                For Athletic is was a second Copa del Rey final defeat in two weeks after they lost to
                                Real Sociedad in the delayed 2020 final on 3 April.</p>

                                Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his first win of the year in a chaotic, incident-strewn
                                Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton fought back to second after a rare error.
                                Rain at the start led to one of the most topsy-turvy races in memory as the treacherous
                                conditions caught out the vast majority of drivers at one time or another.
                                There was an early safety car and later a red flag, after a massive crash involving
                                Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas and Williams's George Russell, rivals for a seat at the world
                                champions in 2022.
                                Even Verstappen almost lost his win, when he half-spun at the restart following the red
                                flag, but he managed to collect the car and streak off into the distance as Hamilton

                                to regain lost ground.
                                It appeared as if Hamilton had gifted his main rival a huge advantage in what promises
                                to be
                                a tight championship fight when he lost control trying to lap Russell and slid into the
                                barriers at half-distance.
                                But the crash between Russell and Bottas a lap later gave him a second opportunity and
                                he
                                made the most of it, fighting back from eighth at the restart to finish second.

                            Fourteen-time winners Arsenal thrashed third-tier side Gillingham 10-0, while West Ham
                            beat Chichester & Selsey 11-0.

                                The European Super League (ESL) is a "disgraceful, self-serving" plan and a "spit in the
                                face of football lovers", says Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin.
                                He also said players who play for teams involved in the closed league would be "banned
                                from the World Cup and Euros".
                                Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among
                                12 clubs who have agreed to join the proposed ESL.
                                UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced a fan-led review of football.
                                Dowden said the review had been brought forward and would offer a "root and branch"
                                review of the sport, covering finance, governance and regulation.
                                He said while football's authorities are equipped to handle the proposed ESL breakaway,
                                the UK government would provide "full backing".
                                "Be in no doubt, if they can't act, we will," added Dowden. "We will put everything on
                                the table to prevent this from happening. We are examining every option. Put simply, we
                                will be reviewing everything the government does to support these clubs."

                                Brooke was riding Orchestrated for her mother, Lady Susan Brooke, when the horse fell at
                                the third fence in a handicap chase on 8 April.
                                The 37-year-old was taken to intensive care at Southmead Hospital in Bristol for
                                observation and tests on a suspected spinal injury.
                                After complications she was placed in an induced coma on Friday.
                                A statement from the Injured Jockeys Fund on Monday said: "It is with deep sadness that
                                we have to share the tragic news that Lorna Brooke passed away yesterday.

                                Great Britain moved a step closer to the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup Finals after Katie
                                Boulter clinched victory in their play-off tie against Mexico.
                                With Britain leading 2-1 in the best-of-five tie, 24-year-old Boulter won 6-4 6-1
                                against Giuliana Olmos.
                                Anne Keothavong's team progress to next year's qualifiers, where another win will put
                                them in the 12-team finals.
                                "We came in with high expectations and the players delivered," said Keothavong.
                                "It is a special feeling at this stage of the competition to get a win. As a team, we
                                haven't been in this position too many times.
                                "I'm proud of all of them to get the job done."
                                After Britain earned a 2-0 lead on Friday, Heather Watson had the chance to secure
                                victory at the first time of asking earlier on Saturday.
                                The British number two lost 6-3 7-6 (7-1) against Mexico's Marcela Zacarias, leaving
                                Boulter with the task of beating Olmos to avoid the tie going to the deciding doubles
                                rubber.
                                Like she did against Zacarias on Friday, Boulter grew stronger as the match wore on and
                                eventually ran out a comfortable winner.
                                The Billie Jean King Cup is the new name for the Fed Cup, the women's international team
                                event that Britain has finished runners-up in four times but has never won.</p>

                                    Tottenham Hotspur's decision to sack Jose Mourinho is a shock when measured by its
                                    timing - but hardly a surprise when judged by the direction of travel of his tenure.
                                    Spurs announced Mourinho's dismissal while under an avalanche of criticism for the
                                    club's move to join the proposed new European Super League but, of more immediate

                                    It is a bold strategy when Mourinho has guided Spurs to within one game of their
                                    first

                                    barely-discernable photo finish.
                                    The 21-year-old Briton, who races for Ineos Grenadiers, appeared to round Belgian
                                    star Wout van Aert in the final sprint for the line in the Netherlands.
                                    Organisers took 15 minutes, studying a digitally enhanced photo, before giving
                                    Jumbo-Visma rider Van Aert the victory.
                                    Meanwhile, Mark Cavendish took his fourth sprint win of the Tour of Turkey in
                                    Sunday's finale.
                                    The Deceuninck-Quick Step rider had not won a race for nearly three years but the
                                    victories herald a major return to form.
                                    Pidcock beat Van Aert, 26, to victory in the Brabantse Pijl classic on Wednesday
                                    with a similar move just before the line to the one seen in Sunday's race in the
                                    Limburg area.
                                    The 219km race is one of cycling's biggest one-day classic races of the season, and
                                    saw Pidcock continue the blistering form he has shown in his first season on the
                                    World Tour with Ineos.
