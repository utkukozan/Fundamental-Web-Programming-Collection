                            "There's this moment where you have fortissimo, tutta forza accents. The thing is to balance
                            this. We are living the drama with an intensity more than with screaming."</p>

                            As traveling is limited and many places in Europe are experiencing rather cold weather, let
                            this selection of vintage images transport you virtually to a warmer place.
                            The photographs feature Parisians enjoying the first days of spring between 1945 to 1950.

                            Contest as part of a trial to see how to reopen venues during the pandemic, the Dutch
                            government has announced.
                            Last year's edition was cancelled as Europe was in the throes of the first wave of the
                            pandemic. This year's contest is to be held in Rotterdam from May 18 to 22 following Dutch
                            singer Duncan Laurence's victory in the 2019 competition.</p>
