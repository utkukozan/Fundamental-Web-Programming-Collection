                            A wildfire is raging out of control on the slopes of Table Mountain above the city of Cape
                            Town, South African authorities say.
                            The blaze has destroyed part of a cafe at the Rhodes Memorial overlooking the city's port.
                            Hundreds of students have been evacuated from a nearby University of Cape Town campus.
                            The fire is moving towards the campus, the Western Cape Government said.
                            Three helicopters are water-bombing the flames.
                            Firefighters were first alerted at 08:45 local time (06:45 GMT). Local environment chief
                            Anton Bredell said the situation was serious and the wind was picking up, which he said was
                            a cause for concern.

                            Charles Geschke, the co-founder of the software company Adobe who helped develop the
                            Portable Document Format, or PDF, has died at the age of 81.
                            Geschke set up Adobe in 1982, giving the world the ubiquitous PDF software, among many other
                            audio-visual innovations.
                            He made headlines 10 years later when he was kidnapped at gunpoint and held for ransom
                            before being released unhurt after a four-day ordeal.
                            Geschke died in California on Friday.
                            Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said Geschke, widely known as Chuck, "sparked the desktop
                            publishing revolution".
                            "This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he
                            has been a guide and hero for decades," he wrote in an email to the company's employees.

                            The seizure is one of the largest ever hauls of the endangered species.
                            Four suspects have been arrested on an island in the ecologically protected province of

                            Giant clams can grow larger than one metre across, and weigh up to 250kg. They are seen as

                                lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic.
                                On Sunday morning Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier
                                attended a morning mass in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a Berlin landmark
                                dedicated to peace and reconciliation.
                                "Sickness, dying and death cannot be just pushed away in this long year," said George
                                Baetzing, chairman of the German Bishops' Conference, during the service. "They have cut
                                deeply into the lives of many people."
                                The two leaders then attended a ceremony broadcast on public television in the
                                Konzerthaus, a concert hall in central Berlin. The number of guests was limited due to

                                confiscated months earlier.
                                Brandon Hole's mother had warned about his mental state last March and police had taken
                                a gun he owned away from him.
                                But he was subsequently able to buy two assault rifles in July and September.
                                On Saturday his family apologised for the "pain and hurt" his actions caused.
                                The 19-year-old former FedEx worker opened fire at the warehouse on Thursday before

                                A doctor for jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has issued a stark warning
                                about the 44-year-old's condition in his third week of hunger strike.
                                Physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday that he had received
                                test results from Navalny's family that made him fear his patient "could die at any
                                minute".
                                According to him, Navalny's test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium,
                                which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels, which indicate

                                    One of France's biggest export industries is facing a devastating blow after an
                                    unusually severe frost earlier this month damaged vineyards across the country,
                                    heaping pain on winemakers already reeling from the pandemic and US tariffs.
                                    The frost has affected 80% of vineyards in France's primary wine growing areas,
                                    according to the European Committee of Wine Companies. "This is expected to cause a
                                    yield loss ranging from 25% to up to 50% in some regions," the trade body told CNN
                                    Business on Wednesday.
                                    The destruction spread across the Rhone Valley, Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne,
                                    Provence and the Loire Valley, said Anne Colombo, president of the Cornas
                                    appellation, a wine-growing area in the Rhone region.
                                    "In some regions there will be very, very few grapes [this year]," she said, adding
                                    that the frost in Cornas is the worst in more than half a century.
                                    Winemakers tried to keep air temperatures up by lighting candles and braziers in
                                    their vineyards, but in many cases it was not enough to protect their budding vines.

                                    A passenger train has derailed in Egypt, causing multiple casualities. Egypt has
                                    been plagued with rail incidents in recent years.
                                    A passenger train derailed just north of the Egyptian capital Cairo on Saturday,
                                    leaving more than 100 people injured.
                                    Al-Arabiya, a Saudi-based broadcaster, reported earlier that at least eight people
                                    have died, but there has been no official confirmation of the death toll.
                                    The train was set to travel to the northeast city of Mansoura.Egypt’s health
                                    minister, Hala Zayed, was heading to the area, according to local reports.
                                    Reuters news agency said eight carriages had overturned, citing a post on the
                                    province's verified Facebook page.
                                    A video on social media purported to show the train lying on its side and widespread
                                    debris. This footage has not been independently verified by DW.
