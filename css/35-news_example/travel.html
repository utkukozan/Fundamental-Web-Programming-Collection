                    <div class="col2">
                        <p class="news-text">
                            In honor of National Park Week, which runs through Sunday, April 25, this company is giving
                            away a $10,000 adventure at one of the country's national parks.
                            Evolve, a plant-based protein shake company, is showing its commitment to getting Americans
                            outdoors by donating $5,000 to the National Park Foundation, as well as offering one person
                            an epic trip to a national park of their choice.
                            Additionally, 50 winners will get an America the Beautiful annual pass (worth $80), which
                            grants access to all national parks and wildlife refuges. Another 100 winners will get a
                            case of Evolve protein shakes.
                            "Over the past year, Americans have experienced a renewed appreciation for spending time
                            outside, and we know that those with active lifestyles are increasingly looking for ways to
                            make incrementally healthier choices that are also more sustainable," Anuj Bhasin of
                            Evolve's parent company, PepsiCo, said in a statement.

                            If you've ever seen a cheetah stalk its prey, you know that even for the fastest animal on
                            the plain, the hunt is an exercise in patience and silence. And if you're lucky enough to be
                            the one stalking a big cat while on safari, you know that pursuit demands the same quiet
                            stamina — until the noiselessness of the prowl is punctured by the diesel roar of your
                            open-air Land Cruiser.
                            Enter the electric safari vehicle, a green innovation that could upend the Kenya safari
                            experience — and help preserve the delicate ecosystems that draw some two million tourists
                            to the country every year.
                            Electric safari cars are the newest offering at a small handful of camps across Kenya, and
                            they promise to both protect the environment and enhance the experience by driving in
                            near-total silence. As of early 2021, Nairobi-based company Opibus converted 10 Land Cruiser
                            safari vehicles from diesel to electric.
                            "We deploy solar [power] and convert vehicles, so that the whole ecosystem creates an
                            off-grid safari system that is independent of the surroundings," says Albin Wilson of
                            Opibus. "Sustainability-wise, it's huge." Once Opibus converts a safari vehicle from diesel
                            to electric, the car charges via a solar panel station. There's no need for the vehicles to
                            burn fuel or make use of the diesel that is trucked into Kenya's nature conservancies and
                            stored in underground tanks, where it threatens to seep out.

                            has completed her float out in St. Nazaire France.
                            The occasion marks a key milestone in her construction, as she makes her way into the water
                            for the very first time.
                            Hot on the heels of game-changing sisters Celebrity Edge and Apex, Celebrity Beyond is set

                            France will look to welcome vaccinated Americans once again this summer, French President
                            Emmanuel Macron said over the weekend, even as the country remains in lockdown.
                            "We will progressively lift the restrictions of the beginning of May, which means that we
                            will organize in the summer time with our professionals in France for French European
                            citizens, but as well for American citizens," Macron said in an interview with CBS' "Face
                            the Nation" on Sunday. "So we are working hard to propose a very concrete solution,
                            especially for U.S. citizens who are vaccinated, so with a special pass, I would say."
                            The country is also working on a certificate for test or vaccine records — like a vaccine
                            passport — to use for travel between European countries. Currently, Macron said officials
                            are "finalizing the technical discussions" to determine what will be required to ease
                            restrictions.
                            "The idea indeed is altogether to offer that to the American citizen when they decide to
                            vaccinate or with a PCR test being negative," he said. "So the idea is indeed to always
                            control the virus, to maximize the vaccination and to progressively lift the restrictions."
